# ebird-R-tut (RETIRED)

Tutorials on working with eBird data in R. 

As of October 2024, this repo has been retired and will no longer be maintained. The code fed into [another repo](https://github.com/rikudoukarthik/r4ebird-intro) that serves as a crash course or workshop for analysing eBird data with R.
